ckanext-discourse-sso
=====================

Adds support for `Discourse SSO
<https://meta.discourse.org/t/official-single-sign-on-for-discourse-sso/13045>`_.
This means that Aleph becomes the authentication authority for a Discourse instance.

When users try to login on Discourse, they get redirected to CKAN. If they are
logged in on CKAN or login when prompted, they get redirected back to Discourse.

Discourse will verify the user's email address (which it gets from CKAN) so that
your discourse instance doesn't become a way to spam your CKAN users.
